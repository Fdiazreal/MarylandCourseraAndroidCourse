This repo is meant as an exercises' backup of the course "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems" from the University of Maryland, at Coursera.

It is not my intention to push this code in order to spoil the solutions. If you are doing the same course, you should not use this as a guide to complete you programming assignments.
